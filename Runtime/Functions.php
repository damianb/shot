/**
 * Trim characters from either (or both) ends of a string in a way that is
 * multibyte-friendly.
 *
 * Mostly, this behaves exactly like trim() would: for example supplying 'abc' as
 * the charlist will trim all 'a', 'b' and 'c' chars from the string, with, of
 * course, the added bonus that you can put unicode characters in the charlist.
 *
 * We are using a PCRE character-class to do the trimming in a unicode-aware
 * way, so we must escape ^, \, - and ] which have special meanings here.
 * As you would expect, a single \ in the charlist is interpretted as
 * "trim backslashes" (and duly escaped into a double-\ ). Under most circumstances
 * you can ignore this detail.
 *
 * As a bonus, however, we also allow PCRE special character-classes (such as '\s')
 * because they can be extremely useful when dealing with UCS. '\pZ', for example,
 * matches every 'separator' character defined in Unicode, including non-breaking
 * and zero-width spaces.
 *
 * It doesn't make sense to have two or more of the same character in a character
 * class, therefore we interpret a double \ in the character list to mean a
 * single \ in the regex, allowing you to safely mix normal characters with PCRE
 * special classes.
 *
 * *Be careful* when using this bonus feature, as PHP also interprets backslashes
 * as escape characters before they are even seen by the regex. Therefore, to
 * specify '\\s' in the regex (which will be converted to the special character
 * class '\s' for trimming), you will usually have to put *4* backslashes in the
 * PHP code - as you can see from the default value of $charlist.
 *
 * @param string
 * @param charlist list of characters to remove from the ends of this string.
 * @param boolean trim the left?
 * @param boolean trim the right?
 * @return string
